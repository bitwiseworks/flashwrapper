# Adobe Flash Player wrapper for OS/2

This repository contains the source code for the Adobe Flash Player wrapper
for the OS/2 operating system.

The Adobe Flash Player wrapper is a plugin DLL for Mozilla and compatible
browsers that wraps around the Adobe Flash Player for Windows using the
[Odin Project](http://trac.netlabs.org/odin32) technology.

The source code in this repository is a courtesy of [Mensys BV](http://mensys.nl)
and [XEU.com BV](https://www.xeu.com) that donated it to the OS/2 community.

Note that the Adobe Flash Player for Windows is not part of this project
and should be downloaded from the Adobe website directly in order for the
wrapper plugin to be useful.
