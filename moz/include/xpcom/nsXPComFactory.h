/*
 * This file contains a macro for the implementation of a simple XPCOM factory.
 *
 * To implement a factory for a given component, you need to declare the
 * factory class using the NS_DEF_FACTORY() macro.
 *
 * The first macro argument is the name for the factory.  
 * 
 * The second macro argument is a function (provided by you) which 
 * can be called by your DLL's NSGetFactory(...) entry point.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   NS_DEF_FACTORY(SomeComponent,SomeComponentImpl)
 *
 *   Declares:
 *   
 *     class nsSomeComponentFactory : public nsIFactory {};
 *
 * NOTE that the NS_DEF_FACTORY takes care of enforcing the "ns" prefix
 * and appending the "Factory" suffix to the given name.
 *
 *   To use the new factory:
 *
 *     nsresult NS_New_SomeComponent_Factory(nsIFactory** aResult)
 *     {
 *       nsresult rv = NS_OK;
 *       nsIFactory* inst = new nsSomeComponentFactory;
 *       if (NULL == inst) {
 *         rv = NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
 *       } else {
 *         NS_ADDREF(inst);
 *       }
 *       *aResult = inst;
 *       return rv;
 *     }
 *
 * NOTE:
 * ----
 *  The factories created by this macro are not thread-safe and do not
 *  support aggregation.
 *
