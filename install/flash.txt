[ Flash Plugin Wrapper for eComStation version 0.4.1 GA ]

This is the first GA release of Flash Plugin Wrapper
for eComStation. It will enable you to use websites
implementing the latest Flash content. For a list of changes
please refer to the end of this document.

It is available to anyone with an active Software Subscription
Services for eComStation, via their download-area at the Mensys
Online Shop: http://www.mensys.net/login/


Introduction
============

The official Flash 5 included with eComStation is outdated and does not
support video playback. The unofficial Flash 7/9 release which can be
found on the internet does not work on a lot of websites as it identifies
itself as Flash 9 but can only display Flash 7 content.

With the new release of this Flash wrapper, up-to-date Flash support for
eComStation is provided. Currently it includes Flash Player 11.5.502.135.

Note: This code should not be used on production systems.
      Please make sure to have a proper backup of your system.


Requirements
============

- Flash Plugin Wrapper for eComStation requires eComStation version 1.2
  or higher. On older versions of eComStation the Flash plugin will refuse
  to work without notice.

- Before installing the plugin please shutdown all your web browser
  sessions.

- On eComStation the default plugin browser plugin path is defined by
  the "SET MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=" variable set in the config.sys.

  If the MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is not found the installer will try to find the
  web browser used by querying the OS2.INI file for the value
  WPURLSETTINGS->DefaultBrowserExe.  It will then copy your plugin file to
  %browser-direcytory%\plugins.

  If the correct path could not be found, the installer will ask you to
  provide the path.

- When Flash 5 from Innotek (included with eComStation by default) or the
  unofficial Flash 7/9 release is found, The DLL's will be renamed so the
  web browser will no longer load the older versions (they will *not* be
  deleted).
  See the section "How to uninstall Flash Plugin Wrapper" for more details.

- This wrapper requires Odin build 0.8.8 or higher. This or a later version
  can be found at the same download location as this package, or at Netlabs:
  ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/odin/
  ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/odin/0.8.8/odin-0.8.8.zip
  If you use rpm installed Odin, please do a "yum update odin" to get the
  latest version.

- Odin requires GCC core 1.2.1 or higher. This or a later version
  can be found at the same download location as this package, or at Netlabs:
  ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/libc/gcc4core-1_2_1.wpi
  If you use rpm installed Odin, then this prereq will be checked and also
  installed if needed.

- Odin requires LIBC 0.6.5 or higher. This or a later version
  can be found at the same download location as this package, or at Netlabs:
  ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/libc/libc-0.6.5-csd5.wpi
  If you use rpm installed Odin, then this prereq will be checked and also
  installed if needed.

* Supported web browsers:

- Firefox 2.0 or higher, including Firefox 3.x, 4.x up to the latest releases
  available
- Seamonkey
- PmW-Fx (builds of the Firefox web browser by Peter Weilbacher)

  Other web browsers, like for example Netscape 4.61, are not supported.

* Supported video drivers:

- SNAP build 3.1.8
- The Panorama video driver

  Both drivers ship with eComStation 1.2R and up.

* Supported audio drivers:

- UNIAUD audio driver; please use the latest UNIAUD from
  http://svn.netlabs.org/uniaud or newer
  (currently either Uniaud195-1924.zip or Uniaud195-211.zip)
- The SB Live driver from Sander van Leeuwen
- The Analog Devices AC 97 driver
- The Cmedia 8738 driver by Rudiger Ihle

  Other audio device drivers may have problems with the audio buffers sent
  to the audio driver by the ODIN layer used by Flash.

* Kernel:

It is recommended to use eComStation with kernel 104a SMP/_W4 or higher.

With the bldlevel.exe command you should have something like this:

[C:\]bldlevel os2krnl
Signature:       @#IBM:14.104a#@_SMP  IBM OS/2 Kernel
Vendor:          IBM
Revision:        14.104
File Version:    14.104
Description:     _SMP  IBM OS/2 Kernel


Known limitations
=================

* Stability:

  While this Flash build is reasonably stable it can sometimes crash your
  web browser and in some occasions block the user input or hang the desktop.
  If your keyboard and mouse input is blocked try to kill your web browser
  with a process killer like Top (available via CAD handler in eComStation)
  or Watchcat. As a last resort you may need to reboot your system by pressing
  Ctrl-Alt-Del.

* Remove old Flash 10 Technology Preview from WarpIn:

  Although not required, it is recommended to remove a possible existing Flash 10
  package from WarpIn prior to installation. This can be done by starting WarpIn
  (Desktop -> Local System -> Install/Remove -> WarpIN -> WarpIN) and
  right clicking the Flash 10 entry in the lefthand pane -> De-install all packages.

* Using SMP:

When running a system with the SMP kernel and having the /SMP switch
defined on the PSD=ACPI.PSD in your config.sys, this might result in
rendering problems with the Panorama video driver, like:

- some text in Flash content might not be displayed correctly
- when running in 64k colour mode, Flash video playback will have strange
  colour patterns rendered. Switching to 16 million colours for the screen
  display fixes this problem. This problem does not occur with the Panorama
  driver that was released in eComStation 2.0 GA.

* When you right click on any SWF content and select 'settings' the dialog
  may be corrupt or at least unusable. If the dialog cannot be closed it
  suffices to reload the webpage so the flash movie reinitializes. The
  settings dialog will disappear then.

* Registry:

  This release of the Flash Plugin Wrapper no longer uses the registry to
  find it's location. You can check with regedit2.exe if the key
  "Flash10_plugin" exists, but it should be removed by the installer.
  If it exists this is not a problem though.

How to uninstall Flash Plugin Wrapper for eComStation
=====================================================

- Start Warpin.exe and select the 3 Flash Plugin Wrapper items in Warpin for
  uninstall.

- Restore previous plugin DLLs:

  When the Flash Plugin Wrapper installer detects Flash 5 (that ships with
  eComStation 1.2 and higher) in the plugin directory, it will rename it. The
  original file is called npswf2.dll and will have been renamed to
  npswf2.dll.flash5.
  Remove the "flash5" portion from the file name so your old plugin will
  work again.
  If you had the "unofficial" flash 7/9 installed remove the ".flash7"
  portion from the file names (npswf2.dll, npswf32.dll and flashwin.dll), to
  restore the functionality of your orginal Flash plugin.
