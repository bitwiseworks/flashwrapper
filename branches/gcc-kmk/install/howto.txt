First warn the user that his web browser must be shutdown. We can check
this via rexx. But not realy needed.
Warpin supports file unlock so if rename files or copy in place the new
Flash it can popup a message the file needs to unlocked. 

We must do our best there are no old Flash builds around:

In the config.sys we set:
SET MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=C:\PROGRAMS\MOZ_PLUG

We need to keep an eye on Flash 5. The DLL is npswf2.dll.
I suggested when found to rename the file by giving it the name with
the entension npswf2.dll.flash5

Flash 7 are the files:
npswf2.dll
NPSWF32.dll
flashwin.dll

Give it the extension .dll.flash7

Another thing is that some users dump files in the plugin directory of
the browser!
For example: \firefox\plugins
Since eCS 1.2 we set the current browser directory in the os2.ini
that can be queried with REXX:

[HINI_USER_PROFILE\WPURLDEFAULTSETTINGS]
DefaultBrowserExe="C:\PROGRAMS\Firefox\firefox!.exe"

There we also need to check if Flash 5 or Flash 7 are around and if
needed rename. 

But in all cases the Flash 10 plugin most goto SET MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=
specified in the config.sys.

Next we also need to include the proper ODIN build for the user.  He
just needs to have a click and
run package. There are multiple sources for this ODIN. By having the
proper
ODIN build in system we prevent crap with people having different
versions.

What the Innotek guys do is slick and we should do the same. Vladest is
possible to keep the ODIN runtime we need out of the libpath ?
Somehow the Java142 code finds the INNOWIN runtime DLL. This is done by
one or more settings in the OPEN32 registry.

I suggested we put the ODIN32 DLL needed in \PROGRAMS\FLASH10.
Put the ODIN.INI in there with the needed modifcication for direct
audio.

Since this is still a beta. Would it not be a good a idea to include an
option to install a debug build and a runtime build.
As a Warpin package. That we we can prevent a lot of problems also. 

We need to automate as much as possible for the end user.
